# Async Control Flow

Today, we covered Asynchronous Control Flow. This is an important topic, because JavaScript will not block the execution of the code and will run code asynchronously.

To illustrate how it works, we used a few examples with `setTimeout`. We saw that callbacks are used whenever we got asynchronous code.

We did also learned that callbacks are used with events and we did a couple of examples using events.

If async is still unclear, don't hesitate and reach out!

Also included is a demo by [Nima and Martin](./demoApp.js) which shows an application using these concepts. (The original can be found [here](https://github.com/martinlaws/lhl-async-control-flow))
